"We are all like fireworks: we climb, we shine and always go our separate ways and become further apart. But even when that time comes, let's not disappear like a firework and continue to shine.. forever."
~ Hitsugaya Toshiro (Bleach)

"Fear is not evil. It tells you what weakness is. And once you know your weakness, you can become stronger as well as kinder."
~Gildarts Clive (Fairy Tail)

"Religion, ideology, resources, land, spite, love or just because… No matter how pathetic the reason, it’s enough to start war. War will never cease to exist… reasons can be thought up after the fact… Human nature pursues strife."
~ Paine (Naruto Shippuden)
